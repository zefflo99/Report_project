# Progress report

**[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)**

> This repo is a template repository to create your own progress report in Markdown.
> The Markdown will be compiled into a static website using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).
> Creating a progress report is a requirement for the CFC of computer scientist applications development in Switzerland.

## How to use

1. Create a new repository using this template repository (click on the green button "Use this template").
2. Clone your new repository on your machine.
3. Edit your base information :
    - In `src/.vitpress/config.mts` :
        - Change the `base` property to your repository name (if you have set a custom repository name).
        - Change the `title` property with your name or pseudo.
        - Change the `socialLinks`property with your GitHub repository link.
        - Change the `editLink` with your repository name.
    - In `src/index.md` :
        - Change the `name` property with your name or pseudo.
4. Install dependencies and run the dev server :
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Then you can make more changes to the Markdown content and see the result in your browser. Donâ€™t forget to check [vitepress Markdown docs](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown).

## How to add your content

You can create new markdown files in the `src` folder. You can create subfolders to organise your content.
You have some default examples in the `src` folder (languages, projects).

You can add images and reference them in your markdown files. You can also add other assets like PDF files.

When you add new pages, you need to add them to the `src/.vitepress/config.mts` file in the `links` array. See [vitepress documentation](https://vitepress.dev/reference/default-theme-nav#navigation-links) for more details about how to add navigation links.

## Deployment

Normally, you don't need to deploy your website. It will be automatically deployed by Github Pages when you push your changes to the `main` branch. (See the Github action in `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`).

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push
```

You can access your website at the following address : `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.
> You may need to activate Github Pages in your repository settings and wait a few minutes for the first build to be completed.
